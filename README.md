  ## Description
  
Rolland Gamos is a rap game where the objective is to identify which rapper has collaborated with which other rapper.  
The game is played in a chain format where the featured artist for one rapper becomes the main artist for the next round. 
Rolland Gamos can be played using a single phone that is passed around between the players (up to three players).  
  
Enjoy !
